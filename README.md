## About the author

The name of my Kaggle account is related to JPato, a plastic duck and my loyal companion since September 2023 (don't forget to visit its Instagram profile: [@jpato.class](https://www.instagram.com/jpato.class)). If you're curious, his name is derived to a word game between "Jefe de Pr√°ctica (JP)" (the technical name of Teaching Assistants at PUCP) and "pato" (the Spanish word for "duck").

My name is Jorge Fatama Vera, CEO of AEDITIP, Data Analyst at FromSolvers and Teaching Assistant at PUCP (where I'm known for bringing JPato with me to every evaluation). I have experience in software development, and recently, I've rediscovered my passion for Computer Science. During this time, I've had the opportunity to work on projects related to business intelligence, data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.

I also have extensive teaching experience. I've been working at PUCP (the top university in Peru and ranked 11th in Latin America according to QS World University Rankings 2025) for six years as a Teaching Assistant in courses covering Programming Fundamentals, Software Development, and Operating Systems. Additionally, in 2022, I founded [AEDITIP](https://www.aeditip.com), an educational organization where I offer courses to Latin American students interested in learning about programming, software development, and computer science.

JPato and I wish you a great day!
